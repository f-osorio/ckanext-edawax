#About

Empirical studies to verify and refine theoretical models are increasingly
important in economics. This is also reflected in a rising number of
empirically-based contributions to journals in which authors have collected
their own research data or used external datasets for their analyses.   

According to many studies in economics and business research, it is still
difficult to replicate the results of published economic research. With this
application we aim to facilitate replications and the reuse of research data
which is increasingly regarded as an important scientific output by learned
societies and research funders.  

##The ZBW Journal Data Archive offers a solution

This application has been developed in the course of the DFG-funded project
[EDaWaX](http://edawax.de) ('European Data Watch Extended'). It offers several
benefits for researchers and editorial offices:   

###For researchers

- Your replication data becomes more visible and receives a DOI (digital object
  identifier).
- The replication files become citable and therefore it is possible to collect
  citations and rewards for sharing your data.
- Studies from other disciplines suggest, that research articles with attached
  data supplements receive more citations.

###For journals
- The management of publication-related research data is facilitated.
- For editorial offices, our services are free of charge.
- The data is stored securely.
- Your journal becomes more visible.
- Readers have confidence in the published research.

This software is based on [CKAN](http://www.ckan.org), a leading open-source
software for data portals around the globe.
