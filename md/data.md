# Data Protection

Protecting your privacy on our website is important to us.

## Anonymous Data Collection

You can visit the webpages of the German National Library of Economics without telling us who you are. We only get to know the name of your internet service provider, the website from which you came to our website and which of our webpages you visit. This information will be used for statistical purposes. You as an individual customer remain anonymous.

##Collection and Processing of Personal Data

If you call up pages and files on this website and are asked to enter private data, these data will be transmitted on the internet via SSL, encrypted and protected against unautorised access.

##Utilisation and Circulation of Personal Data

The personal data collected on the webpages of the German National Library of Economics will only be used without your consent for the execution of contracts and in order to process your enquiries. Beyond this, your data will only be used with your prior consent for advertising and market research and the tailoring of electronic ZBW services to customer requirements. Equally, your data will only be used for tailoring individualised advertising if you have granted your consent. Your data will not be circulated to third parties. You can revoke your consent at any time, effective from the time of revocation.

##Transfer and Processing of Data to Countries outside the European Economic Area

We do not transfer any of these data into states outside the European Union (so-called third countries). This excludes personal data you provide in the webforms sent to Research Guide EconDesk. This data transfer takes place based on the “standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to third countries” of the European Union. Please be aware that the level of data protection in third countries may differ from German and EU standards.

##Cookies

We save so-called session-cookies on your hard drive which are valid only during your visit on our website. These are needed to identify and authorise you after successful login in the protected sections of our website for the duration of your visit. These cookies will automatically be deleted from your hard drive after you have ended your visit.

##External Links

In order to provide you with the best possible information, we offer links to third parties’ websites on our website. Whenever it is not obvious that these are external links we will provide an explicit notice. The German National Library of Economics cannot control the contents and design of third parties’ websites. Therefore, the guarantees given by this data protection statement do not apply to those websites.

##Use of Facebook Social Plugins

Our internet presence uses social plugins (“plugins”) of the social network Facebook.com which is operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. These plugins can be recognised by one of the Facebook logos (white “f” on a blue tile or a “thumbs-up” sign) or are marked as “Facebook social plugin”. As soon as a page of our internet presence which contains such a plugin is accessed, your browser will establish a direct connection with the servers of Facebook. The content of the plugin will be communicated directly from Facebook to your browser and embedded in the website. Facebook obtains the information that you have accessed the corresponding page of our website through the embedding of the plugin. If you are at that time logged into Facebook, Facebook will be able to allocate your visit to your Facebook account. If you interact with the plugins, (e.g. use the “like” button or leave a comment) then this information will be transmitted by your browser directly to Facebook and stored there. Please look up the Data Use Policy of Facebook, if you wish to know more about the purpose and scope of data collection, the further processing and use of these data by Facebook and your corresponding rights and settings options for the safeguarding of your privacy.

##E-mails

If you send us an e-mail, we will use your e-mail address only for corresponding with you. After the end of correspondence, your e-mail address will be deleted. It will not be used for other purposes or transmitted to third parties. We also advise you that unauthorised access and falsification are possible if  e-mails are transmitted without encryption.

##Your Rights

You have the right to demand cost-free access to all personal data held about you.You also have the right to demand that false data be corrected, blocked or deleted. You can revoke your consent to the processing of data for the purposes of advertising and market research at any time, taking effect from the time of revocation.
